I care a lot about getting the science right and I strive for modest, open, reproducible and fair research. Currently, I’m working on a project focussing on offshore songbird migration across the North Sea using motus-powered radio-tracking. Julia, R and Stan are my go-to languages for applied data analysis.\nI’m also a keen birder, freelance ornithological consultant and bird ringer with a penchant for Warblers and Chats."

Consequently, we predict different behavioural decisions to similar environmental cues between short- and long-distance migrants, which has been documented for autumn migration. Here we focus on the question whether trade-off decisions regarding departure, routing, and landing when alternating between migratory endurance flights and stopovers also differ during spring migration. As early arrivals at the breeding grounds should be ultimately favoured regardless of migration distance, selection may favour more similar behavioural decisions in spring than in autumn. We radio-tagged short- and long-distance migratory songbirds at stopover sites along the German North Sea coast during spring and automatically tracked their migratory behaviour using a large-scale network of receiver stations. Once departed, birds could either cross the sea or detour along the coast. We corrected for spatially biased detection data, using a hierarchical multistate model to assess how birds respond to variation in environmental conditions in their day-to-day departure decisions and route selection. The day-to-day departure probability was higher in long-distance migrants independently of the routing decision. Irrespective of migration distance, all species more likely departed under light winds and rainless conditions, while the influence of air pressure change and relative humidity was species-specific. By accounting for detection probabilities, we estimated that about half of all individuals of each species crossed the sea, but did not find differences between short- and long-distance migrants. Offshore flights were more likely when winds blew offshore and began earlier within the night compared to onshore flights. Our results suggest that selection more similarly affects birds of different migration distances in spring than in autumn.

The decision to resume migration from stopover to a large extent shapes the temporal organization of migration. This decision is known to be shaped by a suite of intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as the bird's fuel stores and current weather conditions. However, how departures from stopover are physiologically regulated is largely unknown. We here present data that strongly indicate that corticosterone, a hormone with a stimulatory effect on locomotion, acts as a mediator between fuel stores and departure from stopover. In migrating northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) temporarily caged at stopover, we observed a positive relationship between the change in fuel stores and the concurrent change in glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) levels measured in the birds' droppings. We also found a positive relationship between the change in GCM levels and the change in the intensity of nocturnal migratory restlessness. As in northern wheatears nocturnal migratory restlessness is an accurate proxy for stopover departure likelihood, our results indicate that corticosterone mediates between fuel stores and the decision to resume migration. Our unique longitudinal study represents a considerable advance in our understanding of the endocrine regulation of avian migration.\n                \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                Final version\n                            \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n\n\nNo matching items"

This coincided with a seasonal pattern in the start of nocturnal migratory behaviour (migratory restlessness during the experimental period and actual departures following release) among birds, irrespective of the experimental treatment. Based on these results we suggest that birds' nocturnal departure timing pursues an innate seasonal schedule of migratory activity, which is adjusted to the current length of the night. Such a mechanistic framework provides the potential for cross-calibrating birds' innate seasonal schedule of migratory activity with the current spatiotemporal progress during migration.\n                \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                Final version\n                            \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    2018\n                \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Endocrine regulation of migratory departure from stopover: Evidence from a longitudinal migratory restlessness study on northern wheatears\n                \n                \n                    Cas Eikenaar, Florian Müller, Georg Rüppel & Mareike Stöwe | \n                            Hormones and Behavior\n                        \n                \n                \n                    Most migrating birds make stopovers to replenish fuel stores. The decision to resume migration from stopover to a large extent shapes the temporal organization of migration. This decision is known to be shaped by a suite of intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as the bird's fuel stores and current weather conditions. However, how departures from stopover are physiologically regulated is largely unknown. We here present data that strongly indicate that corticosterone, a hormone with a stimulatory effect on locomotion, acts as a mediator between fuel stores and departure from stopover. In migrating northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) temporarily caged at stopover, we observed a positive relationship between the change in fuel stores and the concurrent change in glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) levels measured in the birds' droppings. We also found a positive relationship between the change in GCM levels and the change in the intensity of nocturnal migratory restlessness. As in northern wheatears nocturnal migratory restlessness is an accurate proxy for stopover departure likelihood, our results indicate that corticosterone mediates between fuel stores and the decision to resume migration. Our unique longitudinal study represents a considerable advance in our understanding of the endocrine regulation of avian migration.\n                \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                Final version\n                            \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n\n\nNo matching items"
